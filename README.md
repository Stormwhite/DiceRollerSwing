# DiceRollerSwing
Small dice roller application written using the Netbeans GUI builder

Looking to port this onto Android and upgrade it to full animation eventually (basically a game), but that's a while off. 

If the basic Android port isn't up in the next month it's because I've concussed myself in exasperation over trying to make a GUI that 
doesn't look awful. I'd say two weeks, but I'm fully aware of my lack of ability in the area.

On that note, if anyone knows any game engines that work with Android's motion APIs and would be friendly to an OOP programmer 
(ideally have easy animation too) message me please.
